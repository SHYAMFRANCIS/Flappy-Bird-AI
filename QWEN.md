# Flappy Bird AI Project

## Project Overview
This is a Flappy Bird AI project, which is an implementation of the popular Flappy Bird game combined with artificial intelligence elements. The project appears to be built using Python and likely uses Pygame or a similar graphics library to create the game environment.

### Key Components
- **Main Game File**: `main.py` - The primary game logic and AI implementation
- **Images Directory**: `imgs/` - Contains all game assets including:
  - `bird1.png`, `bird2.png`, `bird3.png` - Different bird sprite frames for animation
  - `pipe.png` - Pipe obstacles that the bird must navigate through
  - `bg.png` - Background image for the game
  - `base.png` - Base/ground image for the game

```

### Technology Stack
- **Language**: Python
- **Game Framework**: Pygame
- **AI Component**: Implementation likely includes machine learning or AI algorithm for the bird to learn how to play the game

### Setup and Execution
The project includes a virtual environment (`.venv`), indicating it has specific Python dependencies. To run the project:

1. Install pygame:
   ```bash
   pip install pygame
   ```

2. Run the main script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

### Next Steps for Implementation
1. Add actual image assets to the `imgs/` directory
2. Potentially implement AI algorithm for the bird to learn how to play
3. Add game features like high scores, difficulty levels, etc.
