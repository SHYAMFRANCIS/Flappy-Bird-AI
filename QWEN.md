# Flappy Bird AI Project

## Project Overview
This is a Flappy Bird AI project, which is an implementation of the popular Flappy Bird game combined with artificial intelligence elements. The project appears to be built using Python and likely uses Pygame or a similar graphics library to create the game environment.

### Key Components
- **Main Game File**: `main.py` - The primary game logic and AI implementation
- **Images Directory**: `imgs/` - Contains all game assets including:
  - `bird1.png`, `bird2.png`, `bird3.png` - Different bird sprite frames for animation
  - `pipe.png` - Pipe obstacles that the bird must navigate through
  - `bg.png` - Background image for the game
  - `base.png` - Base/ground image for the game

└───.venv/                 # Python virtual environment
```

### Technology Stack
- **Language**: Python
- **Game Framework**: Likely Pygame (based on common implementation approaches)
- **AI Component**: Implementation likely includes machine learning or AI algorithm for the bird to learn how to play the game

### Setup and Execution
The project includes a virtual environment (`.venv`), indicating it has specific Python dependencies. To run the project:

1. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   # On Windows
   .\.venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

2. Run the main script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

### Potential AI Implementation
Based on the project name, this implementation likely includes an AI algorithm that allows the bird to learn how to navigate through the pipes. Common approaches for Flappy Bird AI implementations include:
- Neural networks
- Genetic algorithms
- Q-learning
- Other reinforcement learning techniques

### Development Notes
- The presence of multiple bird frames (`bird1.png`, `bird2.png`, `bird3.png`) suggests the implementation includes animated bird movement
- The project appears to be self-contained with all necessary assets in the `imgs/` directory
- The `.venv` directory indicates proper Python environment management

### Next Steps for Exploration
To fully understand the implementation:
1. Examine the `main.py` file to understand the AI algorithm used
2. Check for any additional Python modules or requirements
3. Look for configuration files that might control AI parameters or game settings
